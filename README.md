# team
Team is a simple npm library for distributed computing, at scale.

You can use team for:

* building microservices architectures
* parallelize and scale very long computations
* simplify scalability of your system

It provides:

* **pattern matching**: a wonderfully flexible way to handle business requirements
* **simple transport layer**: team is backed by redis. You only need to startup a redis server and provide connection URL to the processes
